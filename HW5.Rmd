## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(fpp)
library(fpp2)

library(readxl)
airtraffic <- read_excel("/Users/jasperyeh/Downloads/Air_Traffic_Passenger_Statistics.xlsx")

head(airtraffic)
plot(airtraffic$`Passenger Count`)

data1 <- ts(airtraffic $`Passenger Count`,frequency = 12)
stl_decomp1 <- stl(data1,s.window = "periodic")
plot(stl_decomp1)
attributes(stl_decomp1)

seasadj(stl_decomp1)
plot(airtraffic$`Passenger Count`)
lines(seasadj(stl_decomp1), col="Red")

f_stl1 <- forecast(stl_decomp1)
f_stl1 <- forecast(stl_decomp1,h=15)
f_stl1

decomp_air <- decompose(data1)
attributes(decomp_air)
seasadj(decomp_air)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
